        <p><strong>In the cooperation with Bananain, what we discuss most with our client is user experience.</strong> </p>
<p>Experience or feeling is a very abstract concept. What is the boundary between &quot;feeling something&quot; and &quot;feeling nothing&quot; and how should it be conveyed to users? In the process of sorting out the brand content of Bananain, we found a marker with unique value and extremely high recognition - Tag-less Label. &quot;Tag-less Label&quot; can be used not only as an mark for &quot;feeling nothing&quot;, but also as an eye-catching identification for &quot;feeling something&quot;. Moreover, this stable, flexible, extremely simple and powerful application mode has well translated the proposition on the brand value of Bananain - Live in Future, namely the comfortable experience in the future.</p>
<p>Our cooperation with Bananain can be traced back to 2019 when Bananain’s brand image we designed received very high market evaluation. Bananain has been one of the most influential brands of home clothing in China after several years of development. Besides, the “Tag-less Label” visual system used for Bananain has also become one of the brand images that Chinese consumers are most familiar with and take delight in talking about. </p>
